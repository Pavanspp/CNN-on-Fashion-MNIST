# CNN-on-Fashion-MNIST
Created a Convolutional Neural Network and ran it on the Fashion MNIST dataset. 

Multiple activation functions and loss functions were used to achieve a fairly well working model 

For every model :-

● Learning rate = 0.005

● Batch size = 32

● Epochs = 30

The model achieved a good accuracy of 89.11% on the validation set.

The training accuracy was 95.29% which shows that it did not overfit.
